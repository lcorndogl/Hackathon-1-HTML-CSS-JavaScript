## Proposal

We will create a text-phrase guessing game. The game will present an common, idiomatic phrase, and the user will guess vowels and consonants, or attempt to guess the phrase as a whole. Guesses will be tracked, and a score calculated at depending on how many letters were guessed before the correct answer was arrived at.

## AI Integration 

As a useful tool for sampling a zeitgeist of English text, ai was helpful for presenting uncommon and common idiomatic phrases.
Ai was also used to assist with generating user stories, the content generated was hand edited for suitability. 

## Wireframing

![wireframe](docs/image_2024-11-27_123117416.png)
We decided on this design based on the colours of other market-leading text games (Wordle, NYTimes and Sudoku.com). 
Alternate looks were also proposed as refinements

Demonstrations of the scalability of the site to larger devices are wireframed below

## Troubleshooting

The above demonstrates Copilot missing a linked asset, and taking it's best guess at the filepath for the local CSS. This is a persistent issue with ai-generated links as demonstrated below.

## Coding with AI
This if test was one entirely derived by ai, along with the plan arrived at to refine the first solution we arrived at

## Future Features
The game could have a login funtion, to allow users to track their all-time high scores, and keep a record of successful and unsuccesful solves.
A timer could be added to the game for a more configurable challenge. This could also be tracked across users, and used to 
generate leaderboards based on fastest times and highest scores.
