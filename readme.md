## Proposal
We will create a text-phrase guessing game. The game will present an common, idiomatic phrase, and the user will guess vowels and consonants, or attempt to guess the phrase as a whole. Guesses will be tracked, and a score calculated at depending on how many letters were guessed before the correct answer was arrived at.

##AI Integration 
As a useful tool for sampling a zeitgeist of English text, ai was helpful for presenting uncommon and common idiomatic phrases.
Ai was also used to assist with generating user stories, the content generated was hand edited for suitability. 

##Wireframing

We decided on this design based on the colours of other market-leading text games (Wordle, NYTimes and Sudoku.com) 
Alternate looks were also proposed as refinements
